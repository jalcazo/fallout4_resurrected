# fallout4_resurrected

<img src="banner.jpg"/>

# Warnings / Remembers

| Problem | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| The protagonist's voice is silent when looking into the mirror at the start of the game! | Be sure to go to Steam, properties of the game and change the language to "English"! (found 5/11/23). Happened to me because Steam detected my language as Spanish and didn't care to install the English language files. |
| I want to avoid the Bethesda logo intro. | Open steamapps\common\Fallout 4\Data\Video\ and delete or rename the file ‚ÄúGameIntro_V3_B.bk2‚Äù |
| I don't remember how to turn on/off the pip-boy flashlight. | **HOLD** tab key! |
| I need to remove Piper's Hat because it's clipping with her hair. | Console ("√±" key in Spanish keyboard, the key left to 1 in English keyboard) and write "2f1f.unequipItem a81af" and then "2f1f.removeItem a81af" |
| I don't remember how to activate the V.A.T.S. in combat. | Use the Q key. |
| I don't remember how to throw a grenade or Molotov cocktail | Select it in the Pipboy, and hold TAB in combat to throw it. |
| I don't remember how to sheath or draw my gun. | Hold the R key. |
| [REMEMBER HOW TO HACK TERMINALS!](https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-4-guide-terminal-passwords-hacking/) | **It's VERY important to click on { [ ( etc (that highlight several characters) to remove words or reset attempts!** (it says "Dud" removed and removes a possible key). |

# Tested and discarded mods
  - (Capital Wasteland Behemoths NO! Too much difficult! Although tested and they look and behave good they are too much difficult).
  | FlaconOil's Complete Retexture Project. | NO! Gives a lot of conflicts with other mods in the modlist and performance problems and a heavy drop of FPS in certain areas. 1
  - Immersive Facial Animations REMADE - IFAR. NO! Too exaggerated facial animations even in the lowest presets.
  - Too many other...
